  I started doing Project Euler problems in 2015.
  Since then, I have solved 100+ problems on and off, and have written up solutions to all of them.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a list of hundreds of mathematical problems that require
mathematical knowhow as well as programming skills to come to a solution. Each problem generally has
some mathematical concept hiding behind it. While there is no limit to the amount of time a program can 
take when solving a problem, the site recommends a limit of **one minute**.

Here, I provide solutions to all the problems I have solved so far, focusing on the mathematics
as much as possible. 

On problems where prime numbers are used in the solution, I liberally use the `primesieve` package,
which provides handy prime generation capabilities. This may seem as cheating, but I believe that in 
most cases the actual generation of primes is not the important concept needed to solve the problem.

Project Euler also lists corresponding difficulty of each problem, ranging from 5% to 100%,
in increments of 5. Below you can see all the posts that are demarcated by difficulty.
