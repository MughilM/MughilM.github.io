  As part of the University of Maryland Gemstone Honors program, an interdisciplinary undergraduate
  team consisting of I and six other students researched novel climate visualizations using virtual reality
  under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Penny. The project is titled Data Imaging and Visualization Analysis.

The Gemstone program of the University of Maryland is a division of the Honors program that focuses
on research and thesis writing. It is a 4-year program, with teams being created at the end of freshman year
on student and professor-created projects, culminating in Thesis defense in the spring of senior year.
Each team has a mentor to guide the students throughout the research process.

The project my team and I focused was regarding the state of climate visualization tools used by climate
scientists. They are largely outdated and unintuitive to use. Performing targeted analyses on specific
climate topics can be time-consuming and fairly shallow. To combat this, Dr. Stephen Penny (our mentor) 
proposed using **virtual reality** to produce climate visualizations.

Using an Oculus Rift as our main testing device, we were able to build visualizations of temperature 
recordings and wind currents across the globe, along with a proof-of-concept local visualization of
the Chesapeake Bay. The local visualizations can be used to analysis different climate patterns after 
major events, for example, with Hurricane Harvey.

We also utilized a Leap Motion infrared sensor, which projects the user hands into the VR space. This
adds intuitive user interaction to the tool, through mapping simple gestures to functionalities. For example,
one can close a fist to open a menu to control globe rotations.

We also performed some focus groups of get current Atmospheric and Oceanic Studies individuals 
to get feedback on the tool. The result was the implementation of a zoom feature on the local visualizations.

This was a large collaborative effort between me and the other team members: Teddy Corrales, Erin Estes,
Kevin Ho, Austin Hom, Justin Shen, and Justin Pan. Huge thanks to Dr. Stephen Penny for mentoring and guiding
us throughout the whole process, as well as the Gemstone Honors program for setting up and the 
infrastructure for this research effort. Please see the links above for our final thesis paper, the 
presentation slides, and the presentation recording itself.

**We were awarded the James. A Wallace Outstanding Thesis Award** for our thesis!
