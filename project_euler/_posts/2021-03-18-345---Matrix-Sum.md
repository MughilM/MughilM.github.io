## Introduction

A standard first step in solving the problem is to try to simplify it, either by removing restrictions or considering a smaller version. Imagine if the restriction of having each element be in exactly in one row and column was absent. What would be the maximum sum possible? We would simply select the maximum value in each row/column and that would be our answer. Therefore, the actual _Matrix sum_ is smaller than this theoretical maximum sum. We need to find a way to choose other elements such that it decreases the theoretical maximum as little as possible.

For example, the theoretical maximum sum in the 5-by-5 example is $767 + 473 + 563 + 959 + 973 = 3735$. The actual answer (3315) is slightly less than this, as we would need to change our number selection. Intuitively, we want to decrease the sum by the smallest amount, and the algorithm we will use to formalize this is called the Hungarian Algorithm.

## Hungarian Algorithm

The [Hungarian Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) is an optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. It primarily operates on finding the *minimum* assignment. For example, if we have 3 people and need to assign 3 different jobs to them, where each person asks for a different price for each price, how do we find the assignment of jobs to people that results in the lowest total cost? 

An equivalent statement is to find the minimum weight bipartite graph matching between two sets of vertices. One set is the set of people $P$, and the second set is the set of jobs $J$. An edge between $p\in P$ and $j\in J$ represents the cost of job $j$ to person $p$.

If we want to apply this algorithm to finding the *maximum*, then we negate the entire matrix and apply the same steps. The steps of the algorithm reflect the intuition of finding the *smallest* decrease in total sum in the case of collisions e.g. in the 5-by-5 example, 473 is the highest value in the second column, but we needed to choose 383 (the second highest value) in order to find the optimal solution. The Hungarian Algorithm finds these secondary selections systematically. 

Since we have a matrix of values, I will go through the algorithm using the steps shown in [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm#Matrix_interpretation).

### Example

#### Step 0

The answer asks us to find the *maximum*, but the algorithm only works on *minimizing.* Thus, we will **negate the entire matrix.**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	-7 & -53 & -183 & -439 & -863 \\
	-497 & -383 & -563 & -79 & -973 \\
	-287 & -63 & -343 & -169 & -583 \\
	-627 & -343 & -773 & -959 & -943 \\
	-767 & -473 & -103 & -699 & -303 
\end{bmatrix}
$$


#### Step 1

The first step (after negating the matrix) is to subtract the minimum value **from each row and column.**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	856 & 516 & 494 & 424 & 0 \\
	476 & 296 & 224 & 894 & 0 \\
	296 & 226 & 54 & 414 & 0 \\
	332 & 322 & 0 & 0 & 16 \\
	0 & 0 & 478 & 68 & 464
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Intuitively, the zeroes represent the minimum points in each row and column, and the nonzero values represent the "extra cost" of switching your selection to that value. For example, the bottom left 0 corresponds to the value of 767 in the original matrix. If we instead picked the value 4 spots to the left to be in our sum (699) this represents a 68 increase in the "cost" i.e. our maximum sum decreased by 68.

Since we subtracted the minimum from each row and column, the corresponding intuition is slightly complicated, but the information is still neatly baked into this new matrix.

Through multiple refinements of this matrix, our ultimate goal is to find a single zero in each row and column. The locations of these zeroes will tell us which values in the original matrix correspond to our sum.

#### Step 2

Create an assignment of zeroes. The only restriction is that there should not be more than one assigned zero in each row and column. For example, we can do the following:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	856 & 516 & 494 & 424 & \color{red} 0 \\
	476 & 296 & 224 & 894 & 0 \\
	296 & 226 & 54 & 414 & 0 \\
	332 & 322 & \color{red} 0 & 0 & 16 \\
	\color{red} 0 & 0 & 478 & 68 & 464
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Next, we **cover all zeroes using the minimum number of lines**. There are multiple ways to do this, and the Wikipedia article gives good detail into a method. Using this method, the last column, and the fourth and fifth rows get covered (in green). The bolded elements are the ones which are covered twice (we will need these for the next step).

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	856 & 516 & 494 & 424 & \color{red} 0 \\
	476 & 296 & 224 & 894 & \color{green} 0 \\
	296 & 226 & 54 & 414 & \color{green} 0 \\
	\color{green}332 & \color{green}322 & \color{red}0 & \color{green}0 & \color{green} \mathbf{16} \\
	\color{red}0 & \color{green}0 & \color{green}478 & \color{green}68 & \color{green} \mathbf{464}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Notice we are still saving the existing assignment.

#### Step 3

If **we do not have a valid assignment of at least $n$ zeroes,** then find the smallest value which is uncovered, and subtract this from all uncovered elements. Additionally, add this value to any elements which are covered by two lines. 

In our matrix, the *smallest uncovered value* is **54**. We subtract this from all elements in black. We also add 54 to the two elements that are covered twice (the green bolded numbers). Thus, our resulting matrix is 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	802 & 462 & 440 & 370 & 0 \\
	422 & 242 & 170 & 840 & 0 \\
	242 & 172 & 0 & 360 & 0 \\
	332 & 322 & 0 & 0 & 70 \\
	0 & 0 & 478 & 68 & 518
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This step is equivalent to solving a single collision, because this step generates an additional zero.

Then we go back to step 2, and repeat. 

#### Repeat

When we repeat, we preserve the original assignment of zeroes from the previous step. However, in the process of finding the minimum line covering, a new assignment also gets generated (see [step 4 in the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm#Step_4)). In this case, the last row, and the third, fourth, and fifth columns get covered, and the following is our new assignment.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	802 & 462 & \color{green} 440 & \color{green}370 & \color{red}0 \\
	422 & 242 & \color{green}170 & \color{green}840 & \color{green}0 \\
	242 & 172 & \color{red}0 & \color{green}360 & \color{green}0 \\
	332 & 322 & \color{green}0 & \color{red}0 & \color{green}70 \\
	\color{red}0 & \color{green}0 & \color{green}\mathbf{478} & \color{green}\mathbf{68} & \color{green}\mathbf{518}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Once again, we find the smallest uncovered value (172), and subtract from all uncovered values, and add this to the 3 values that are double-covered.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	630 & 290 & 440 & 370 & 0 \\
	250 & 70 & 170 & 840 & 0 \\
	70 & 0 & 0 & 360 & 0 \\
	160 & 150 & 0 & 0 & 70 \\
	0 & 0 & 650 & 240 & 690
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Again repeat

The assignment does not change, and the minimum covering results in the last column, and the third, fourth, and fifth columns getting covered.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	630 & 290 & 440 & 370 & \color{red}0 \\
	250 & 70 & 170 & 840 & \color{green}0 \\
	\color{green}70 & \color{green}0 & \color{red}0 & \color{green}360 & \color{green}0 \\
	\color{green}160 & \color{green}150 & \color{green}0 & \color{red}0 & \color{green}70 \\
	\color{red}0 & \color{green}0 & \color{green}650 & \color{green}240 & \color{green}690
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The smallest uncovered value is 70:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	560 & 220 & 370 & 300 & 0 \\
	180 & 0 & 100 & 770 & 0 \\
	70 & 0 & 0 & 360 & 0 \\
	160 & 150 & 0 & 0 & 70 \\
	0 & 0 & 650 & 240 & 690
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Repeat once more

At this point, when we find the minimum covering, we see that we need **five lines** to do so. This simultaneously means that there is an assignment such that there is exactly one assigned zero in each row and column. The location of these zeroes give us the answer:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	560 & 220 & 370 & 300 & \color{red}0 \\
	180 & \color{red} 0 & 100 & 770 & 0 \\
	70 & 0 & \color{red} 0 & 360 & 0 \\
	160 & 150 & 0 & \color{red} 0 & 70 \\
	\color{red} 0 & 0 & 650 & 240 & 690
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Notice these match up exactly with the matrix sum in the problem above. At this point, we are done!

## Code

In terms of code, each step maps cleanly to a step we can implement. The most complicated step is finding the minimum covering. We create two separate arrays to keep track which rows and columns are covered. We also have `assign_zeroes` and `find_uncovered_zero` which creates an assignment of zeroes and finds the first uncovered zero respectively. Our matrix is an `np.ndarray`, which allows for some convenient indexing. The entire logic is put in a loop, because we need to keep looping until we find an assignment with the proper number of zeroes. Finally, the large matrix is kept in a space-delimited text file, which is read directly and put into a matrix.

```python
def assign_zeroes(data: np.ndarray):
    # Generates an "assignment" of zeroes based on the following rule.
    # An assigned zero cannot be in the same row or column as
    # another assigned zero.
    assigned = []
    cols_available = list(range(data.shape[1]))
    for r in range(data.shape[0]):
        for c in cols_available:
            if data[r, c] == 0:
                assigned.append((r, c))
                cols_available.remove(c)
                break
    return assigned

def find_uncovered_zero(data: np.ndarray, row_cover_mask, col_cover_mask):
    for r in np.where(~row_cover_mask)[0]:
        for c in np.where(~col_cover_mask)[0]:
            if data[r, c] == 0:
                return r, c
    return None

def hungarian(data: np.ndarray):
    # Subtract the minimum from each row
    data -= np.min(data, axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]

    # Subtract the minimum from each column (transpose and repeat above)
    data = (data.T - np.min(data, axis=0)[:, np.newaxis]).T

    # Go through each row, and "assign" the zeroes.
    # Assignments can't be in the same row or column as the others
    # Save the locations as tuples...
    assigned = np.asarray(assign_zeroes(data))

    # We keep refining until the number of assigned zeros reaches
    # the number of columns
    while len(assigned) < data.shape[1]:
        # There is a chance that this isn't the best assignment.
        # So we will refine this further. We keep refining until
        # we have a complete covering.
        # The first basic covering is to cover each column which
        # has a 0.
        row_cover_mask = np.zeros(data.shape[0], dtype=bool)
        col_cover_mask = np.zeros(data.shape[1], dtype=bool)

        # Initialize just using columns to attempt to cover 0s.
        col_cover_mask[[c for _, c in assigned]] = True

        primed_zeros = []

        # We try to cover ALL the zeroes using the fewest number of lines.
        # During the process, it is possible that we end up assigning one more zero.
        while np.any(data[:, ~col_cover_mask][~row_cover_mask] == 0):
            # Find an uncovered zero and prime it.
            uncover_r, uncover_c = find_uncovered_zero(data, row_cover_mask, col_cover_mask)
            primed_zeros.append((uncover_r, uncover_c))
            # If the zero is on the same row as an assigned zero, then we cover the row, and uncover
            # the column of the assigned zero.
            if uncover_r in assigned[:, 0]:
                row_cover_mask[uncover_r] = True
                col_cover_mask[assigned[np.where(assigned[:, 0] == uncover_r)][0, 1]] = False
                continue
            else:
                # This means the uncovered zero doesn't have an assigned zero on the row.
                # Find an assigned zero in the same column,
                # then find a primed zero in the same row as the assigned zero.
                # Keep going until we don't find an assigned zero in the column,
                # and keep track of the path...
                curr_r, curr_c = uncover_r, uncover_c
                assigned = np.append(assigned, [[curr_r, curr_c]], axis=0)
                primed_zeros.remove((curr_r, curr_c))
                while curr_c in assigned[:-1, 1]:
                    # Get the row of the assigned zero in this column (don't include the
                    # location we just assigned)
                    loc = np.where(assigned[:-1, 1] == curr_c)[0][0]
                    # Extract the location
                    assigned_r, assigned_c = assigned[loc, 0], assigned[loc, 1]
                    # This assigned zero becomes a primed zero, so delete it
                    # from the assigned list.
                    assigned = np.delete(assigned, loc, axis=0)
                    # Find the primed zero on this row and turn this into
                    # an assigned zero, and set the current column accordingly...
                    primed_r, primed_c = [(r, c) for r, c in primed_zeros if r == assigned_r][0]

                    primed_zeros.append((assigned_r, assigned_c))

                    primed_zeros.remove((primed_r, primed_c))
                    assigned = np.append(assigned, [[primed_r, primed_c]], axis=0)
                    curr_c = primed_c

                # In this process, we have assigned one more zero.
                # Get rid of all the primed zeros, and recover the lines.
                primed_zeros = []
                row_cover_mask = np.zeros(data.shape[0], dtype=bool)
                col_cover_mask = np.zeros(data.shape[1], dtype=bool)
                col_cover_mask[[c for _, c in assigned]] = True

        # If we ended up assigning one more zero, and this led us to have the correct number,
        # then break out of the loop, we have our answer.
        if len(assigned) == data.shape[1]:
            break
        # Otherwise, we find the least element that is NOT covered by a line, and subtract
        # it from each element NOT covered by a line, and add it to each element covered
        # by TWO lines. Then we repeat the process.
        min_value = np.min(data[~row_cover_mask][:, ~col_cover_mask])
        row_lines = np.where(~row_cover_mask)[0]
        col_lines = np.where(~col_cover_mask)[0]
        # Use an inverse zip with product to correctly format the locations where we need to subtract
        rows, cols = zip(*[prod for prod in product(row_lines, col_lines)])
        data[rows, cols] -= min_value
        # Use product to pair the locations where lines cross
        for r, c in product(np.where(row_cover_mask)[0], np.where(col_cover_mask)[0]):
            data[r, c] += min_value

    return assigned

data = np.loadtxt('./problem345.txt', dtype=np.int32)

sum_path = hungarian(-1 * data)
print(sum_path)
rows, cols = zip(*sum_path)
print(data[rows, cols])

# Index into the array and simply return the sum
matrix_sum = sum(data[rows, cols])
print('Maximum sum:', matrix_sum)
```

Running this long code, we get

```bash
[[ 0  9]
 [ 2  7]
 [ 6 13]
 [ 7  2]
 [ 8 14]
 [ 9 11]
 [10  6]
 [11  5]
 [12 12]
 [14  1]
 [ 3  4]
 [13  8]
 [ 5  0]
 [ 4  3]
 [ 1 10]]
[973 993 992 972 848 976 969 901 823 883 853 966 870 962 957]
Maximum sum: 13938
0.013088769000034972 seconds.

```

Therefore, the matrix sum for the large matrix is **13938**. This was a good exercise in converting an algorithm into a program.
