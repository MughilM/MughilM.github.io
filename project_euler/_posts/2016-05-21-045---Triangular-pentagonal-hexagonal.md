Just like how hexagons are composed of triangles, hexagonal numbers are themselves triangle numbers:

$$
H_n=n(2n-1)=\frac{1}{2}(2n)(2n-1)=\frac{1}{2}(2n-1)((2n-1)+1)=T_{2n-1}
$$
One equality pair is already done, so now we only have to find the next hexagonal number which is also a pentagonal number. Using the same function as [#44 - Pentagonal numbers](/blog/project_euler/2016-05-20-044-Pentagonal-numbers){:.heading.flip-title}, we can set up a single loop starting from $H_{143}$ going on up.
```python
# file: "problem045.py"
n = 144  # H_143 is pentagonal
hexNum = n * (2 * n - 1)
while not isPentagonal(hexNum):
    n += 1
    hexNum = n * (2 * n - 1)

print(n, hexNum)
```
Running this quick loop results in,
```
27693 1533776805
0.03727003511300319 seconds.
```
Therefore, $H_{27693} = \mathbf{1533776805}$ is the next number which is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal.
