Since we are only concerned about numbers with two factors, the larger of the two must not be more than half the limit. We can solve this with a double for loop if we have a prime flag array. The maximum value of the smaller prime can't exceed the square root of the limit. Once we have this factor, we count all primes that are larger than this prime and add it to a running total. By enforcing the smaller factor, it avoids double counting $2\times 3$ and $3\times 2$ twice. I use `primesieve.numpy as pnp` so I can easily flag the primes.

```python
# file: "problem187.py"
limit = 10 ** 8
# Only need primes halfway
primes = pnp.primes(limit / 2)
# Take as little space as possible with
# np.uint8
primeFlags = np.zeros(limit // 2, dtype=np.uint8)
primeFlags[primes] = 1
del primes  # Get rid of it, we don't need it anymore!

total = 0
i = 0
# The smaller of the two can't exceed the 
# square root of the limit...
while i <= limit ** 0.5 + 1:
    if primeFlags[i]:
        # Count primes up till limit // i to ensure
        # the resulting number does not exceed
        # the limit.
        total += np.sum(primeFlags[i: limit // i + 1])
    i += 1
print(total)
```
Running this short loop, we get
```
17427258
0.22744560000000003 seconds.
```
Thus, there are **17427258** composite integers below $10^8$ with exactly two prime factors.
