The problem itself tells us how to solve it. There is no need for anything complicated. In Python, there is the `ord()` function, which returns the ASCII integer code for the given character. Additionally, since "A" has a value of 65, we need to subtract 64 from the value of `ord()` so that "A" properly maps to 1.
```python
# file: "problem022.py"
# Each name is in double quotes, separated
# by commas. So remove the quotes and split on the comma.
with open("problem022.txt") as f:
    names = f.readline().replace('"', '').split(',')
names.sort()  # sort alphabetically

total = 0

for i, name in enumerate(names, 1):
    score = 0
    # For each letter, grab the ASCII code integer,
    # and subtract 64, because 'A' is 64.
    for chara in name:
        score += ord(chara) - 64
    score *= i + 1
    total += score
print(total)
```
Running this simple loop, we get
```
871522818
0.007237999991048127 seconds.
```
Thus, **871522818** is our answer.
