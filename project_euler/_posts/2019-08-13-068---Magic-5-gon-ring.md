The string will concatenate 15 numbers, 3 for each of the 5 arms. Numbers on the inner ring will be repeated twice. If 10 is on the outer ring, then it will be present once in the string, which means the length of the string will be 16 (one digit for 14 circles, plus 2 for the single 10). Thus, **10 has to be on the outer ring.**

To ensure proper looping without resorting to brute force, we can loop through all sets of 5 unique numbers that contain 10 to place in the outer ring. Since ring strings start with the smallest number, we can use this to enforce the ordering.

Once the 5 numbers are placed, we can fill in the first arm using 2 numbers. This sets the sum in stone that must be satisfied in the other 4 arms. We test if a solution is possible using the remaining numbers.

I use `itertools.permutations` to quickly loop through the groups of 5 numbers.
```python
# file: "problem068.py"
def filterOut(toRemove, origList):
    return [ele for ele in origList if ele not in toRemove]

# Okay, so basically, we have to
# loop through all possible locations
# for numbers in the outer circle and
# pair of numbers for the first petal.
maxNum = 10
numList = list(range(1, maxNum + 1))
c = 0
allPerms = []
for i in range(1, maxNum + 1):
    for perm in permutations(list(range(i + 1, maxNum + 1)), maxNum // 2 - 1):
        if 10 in perm:
            allPerms.append((i,) + perm)
            c += 1
for perm in allPerms:
    # Get numbers that are remaining
    copied = filterOut(perm, numList)
    # All possible pairs of numbers that can be placed
    # into the 2 remaining circles.
    for pair in permutations(copied, 2):
        # Make a small 2d array of the sums...
        ring = np.zeros((maxNum // 2, 3), dtype=int)
        ring[:, 0] = perm
        # Assign the pair...
        ring[0, 1:] = pair
        # The second number in the pair is also the
        # second number in the second leg...
        ring[1, 1] = pair[1]
        # The first number in the pair is also
        # the third number in the last leg
        ring[-1, 2] = pair[0]
        # Calculate the required sum
        sumToMeet = sum(ring[0])
        # Filter out the pair...
        innerNumsLeft = filterOut(pair, copied)
        # Okay, we have our sum and starting
        # numbers. Now we can keep putting
        # required numbers until it's impossible
        # to put anymore. We keep removing from the list.
        # If we finish the loop, and the list is empty,
        # then we've placed everything..
        i = 1  # Current sum row.
        while len(innerNumsLeft) > 0 and i < maxNum // 2 - 1:
            # Calculate number that should go here...
            requiredNum = sumToMeet - sum(ring[i])
            # If the required number is not in the list,
            # then it's impossible, and we break and go
            # to the next setup.
            if requiredNum not in innerNumsLeft:
                break
            # If this is the last number
            # placed, we also need to check
            # the other leg that has been filled.

            # Otherwise remove it, add it to
            # the ring, and go to the next leg.
            ring[i, 2] = requiredNum
            ring[i + 1, 1] = requiredNum
            innerNumsLeft.remove(requiredNum)
            i += 1
        # Check to see if we placed all the
        # numbers, and that the last leg is
        # the correct sum
        if len(innerNumsLeft) == 0 and sum(ring[-1]) == sumToMeet:
            print(''.join(map(str, np.ravel(ring))))
```
Running this code outputs all 16-digit configurations:
```
2594936378711015
2951051817673439
6357528249411013
6531031914842725
0.8801705000000002 seconds.
```
Therefore, the maximum 16-digit string is **6531031914842725**.
